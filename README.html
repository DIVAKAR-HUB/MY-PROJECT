<h2><font color=red>HISTORY</font></h2>
<p>The region of Tamil Nadu in the southeast of modern India, shows evidence of having had continuous human habitation from 15,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE.
  
  Throughout its history, spanning the early Upper Paleolithic age to modern times, this region has coexisted with various external cultures.

  The three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola, and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land with a unique culture and language, 
  contributing to the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in the world. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other vying for hegemony over the land.<br><p>
Invasion by the Kalabhras during the 3rd century disturbed the traditional order of the land, displacing the three ruling kingdoms. These occupiers were overthrown by the resurgence of the Pandyas and the Pallavas,
who restored the traditional kingdoms. The Cholas who re-emerged from obscurity in the 9th century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas rose to become a great power
and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km² (1,389,968 sq mi) straddling the Bay of Bengal.</br></p><br><p>
 The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia.
 Rapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest 
and the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the 14th century.</br></p> <br><p> Despite this, the Vijayanagara Empire gained a foothold in 
the region from the late 14th century until the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Maratha Empire expanded its territories into the northern
 regions of present-day Tamil Nadu. The Madras Presidency, comprising most of southern India, was created in the late 18th century and was ruled directly by the British.
After the independence of India, after the Telugu and Malayalam parts of Madras state were separated from Tamilagam state in 1956, it was renamed as Tamil Nadu on January 14, 1969, by the state government.</br></p>
<h2><font color=red>CULTURE</font></h2>
<br><p>Tamil culture refers to the culture of the Tamil people. The Tamils speak the Tamil language, one of the oldest languages in India with more than two thousand years of written history.

  Archaeological evidence from the Tamilakam region indicates a continuous history of human occupation for more than 3,800 years. Historically, the region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people.
  <br><p> It was ruled by various kingdoms such as the Sangam period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) triumverate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE), and the later 
    Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century CE). European colonization began in the 17th century CE, and continued for two centuries until the Indian Independence in 1947. Due to its long history, 
    the culture has seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.</br></p>
  
 <br><p> The Tamils had outside contact in the form of diplomatic and trade relations with other kingdoms to the north and with the Romans since the Sangam era. The conquests of Tamil kings in the 10th century
   CE resulted in Tamil culture spreading to South and Southeast Asia. Tamils form the majority in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu and a significant portion of northern Sri Lanka. Tamils have migrated world-wide
    since the 19th century CE and a significant population exists in Sri Lanka, South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji, as well as other regions such as the Southeast Asia, Middle East, Caribbean and parts of the Western World.</br></p>
  
 <br><p> History
  Further information: History of Tamil Nadu and Tamilakam
  Tamilakam was the region inhabited by the ancient Tamil people. While archelogical evidence points to hominids inhabiting the region nearly 400 millenia ago, it has been inhabited by modern humans continuously for
   more than 3,800 years. Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed urban settlements dating to the 6th century BCE. The Tamilakam region has been ruled over by many kingdoms,</br></p>
  <br><p> major of which are the Sangam era (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE) rulers of the Chera, Chola, and Pandya clans,the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE),and the later Vijayanagara
     Empire (14th–17th century CE). The kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and with the Romans. In the 11th century CE, the Chola empire expanded with  
  Before mid 20th century, the regions populated by Tamils were under European colonization for more than two centuries.</br></p><br><p>During the European occupation, Tamils migrated and settled in various regions
   across the globe. This resulted in significant Tamil population in Southeast Asia, Caribbean, South Africa, Mauritius, Seychelles and Fiji. Since the 20th century, Tamils have migrated to other regions
   such as Middle East and the Western World for employment. Tamils form the majority in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu and in northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.</br></p>
